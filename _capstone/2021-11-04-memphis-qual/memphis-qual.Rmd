# Methodology

Current regulation of housing quality in the private rental market assumes that tenants will report substandard housing, yet this is often not the case. Regulations that rely on their reporting fail to protect tenants from retaliation, and low-income households may lack housing alternatives [@chisholm2018]. In this scenario, tenants must choose between living in substandard housing, or jeopardizing their housing stability.

This paper will use Memphis, Tennessee as a case study to explore how these problems manifest in a particular place. First, I will explore the laws and regulations that govern housing quality in the private rental market. Then, I will examine data to determine the amount of housing alternatives available for low-income renters. Finally, I will analyze code enforcement data to see how often tenants do report problems, and how those problems are resolved.

# Housing Quality Regulations

## Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA)

The Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) was created in 1972 by the Uniform Law Commission to modernize laws governing rental units. Prior to URLTA, landlords and tenants were bound by common law developed in an agricultural society, based on a theory that a rental lease gave the tenant land, and any buildings or improvements were incidental. Landlords had no obligation to maintain structures; for example, a Tennessee Supreme Court case from 1854 found a tenant responsible for all rent, despite his home having been flooded and made uninhabitable [@scott2003].

URLTA changed many of the agrarian common law principles, notably creating a warranty of habitability for tenants. Under the warranty of habitability, landlords are required to provide and maintain habitable conditions for the premises. If conditions become uninhabitable, URLTA provides remedies to the tenant, including termination of the lease [@scott2003].

Tennessee was one of the first ten states to enact a version of URLTA, adopting it in 1975. However, Tennessee is unique in that it is the only state that limits URLTA's application based on population; the law only applies to counties with more than 75,000 people based on the 2010 census. [@uniform1975a] While renters in Shelby County qualify for protection under URLTA, residents of neighboring Tennessee counties are excluded.[^1]

[^1]: The Memphis MSA covers three states: Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Residents in Mississippi counties are protected under URLTA with no population exemptions. However, Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with no warranty of habitability for renters, and thus landlords are not legally required to maintain habitable conditions.

Under Tennessee's URLTA, landlords are required to comply with building and housing codes, make repairs, and keep the premises clean and safe [@uniform1975a §304]. They must provide "essential services," which include utilities and obligations which "materially affect the health and safety of the tenant" [@uniform1975a §502(3)]. If a landlord fails to supply essential services, tenants "shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the breach" and do one of the following: obtain essential services and deduct their cost from the rent; recover damages based on the decrease in the fair rental value; or procure reasonable substitute housing, during which the tenant is excused from paying rent during the period of noncompliance [@uniform1975a §502(1)].

Tenants who give their landlord written notice and follow the remedies laid out in the code are supposed to be protected from retaliation, including rent increases, decreased services, or eviction [@uniform1975a §514]. This may adequately protect tenants under a long-term lease; however, protections are more vague for tenants on short-term leases. Landlords are allowed to evict week-to-week or month-to-month tenants for no cause, as long as adequate notice is given (10 or 30 days, respectively) [@uniform1975a §512].

How are tenants meant to be protected from retaliatory eviction if landlords need no cause to evict in the first place? How long do retaliation protections last? These arguments have lead some states, like California and Washington, to enact "just cause" eviction ordinances, requiring landlords to provide a specific, valid reason to evict tenants (such as non-payment of rent) [@apstaff2021]. With the absence of such protections in Tennessee, lawyers at local renter rights meetings recommend tenants continue paying rent and keep a record of any photos, receipts, and conversations with their landlord.

## International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) and Code Enforcement

As stated above, URLTA requires landlords to comply with building and housing codes, which are established at the local level. In 2018, Memphis replaced local housing codes by adopting the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) [@harrison2018]. The IPMC sets minimum housing standards for existing residential buildings and related environmental conditions. The IPMC is enforced by the Department of Code Enforcement [@codeenf].

Once a complaint is received, an investigation is conducted to assess the violation, determine property ownership, and research past violations at the property. If warranted, a Code Inspector will issue a Notice to Correct Violation to the property owner. After a Notice is issued, follow-up inspections are conducted to determine compliance. Depending on the circumstances and severity, the department can then: give an extension; cite the owner to court; issue an order to vacate; issue an order to not occupy until repairs are made; or refer the property to the Condemnation Department. Cases where court action is initiated are resolved in the General Sessions Environmental Court [@codeenf].
