# Methodology

Current regulation of housing quality in the private rental market assumes that tenants will report substandard housing, yet this is often not the case. Regulations that rely on their reporting fail to protect tenants from retaliation, and low-income households may lack housing alternatives \[@chisholm2018\]. In this scenario, tenants must choose between living in substandard housing, or jeopardizing their housing stability.

This paper will use Memphis, Tennessee as a case study to explore how these problems manifest in a particular place. First, I will explore the laws and regulations that govern housing quality in the private rental market. Then, I will examine data to determine the amount of housing alternatives available for low-income renters. Finally, I will analyze code enforcement data to see how often tenants do report problems, and how those problems are resolved.

# Housing Quality Laws

## URLTA

The Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) was created in 1972 by the Uniform Law Commission to modernize laws governing rental units. Prior to URLTA, landlords and tenants were bound by common law developed in an agricultural society, based on a theory that a rental lease gave the tenant land, and any buildings or improvements were incidental. Landlords had no obligation to maintain structures; for example, a Tennessee Supreme Court case from 1854 found a tenant responsible for all rent, despite his home having been flooded and made uninhabitable \[@scott2003\].

URLTA changed many of the agrarian common law principles, notably creating a warranty of habitability for tenants. Under the warranty of habitability, landlords are required to provide and maintain habitable conditions for the premises. If conditions become uninhabitable, URLTA provides remedies to the tenant, including termination of the lease \[@scott2003\].

Tennessee was one of the first ten states to enact a version of URLTA, adopting it in 1975. However, Tennessee is unique in that it is the only state that limits URLTA's application based on population; the law only applies to counties with more than 75,000 people based on the 2010 census. \[@uniform1975\] While Memphians, located in Shelby County, qualify for protection under URLTA, residents of neighboring Tennessee counties are excluded.[^1]

[^1]: The Memphis MSA covers three states: Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Residents in Mississippi counties are protected under URLTA with no population exemptions. However, Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with no warranty of habitability for renters, and thus landlords are not legally required to maintain habitable conditions.
