# Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA)

The Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) was created in 1972 by the Uniform Law Commission to modernize laws governing rental units. Prior to URLTA, landlords and tenants were bound by common law developed in an agricultural society, based on a theory that a rental lease gave the tenant land, and any buildings or improvements were incidental. Landlords had no obligation to maintain structures; for example, a Tennessee Supreme Court case from 1854 found a tenant responsible for paying all rent due on his lease, despite his home having been flooded and made uninhabitable [@scott2003].

URLTA changed many of the agrarian common law principles, notably creating a warranty of habitability for tenants. Under the warranty of habitability, landlords are required to provide and maintain habitable conditions for the premises. If conditions become uninhabitable, URLTA provides remedies to the tenant, including termination of the lease [@scott2003].

Tennessee was one of the first ten states to enact a version of URLTA, adopting it in 1975. However, Tennessee is unique in that it is the only state that limits URLTA's application based on population; the law only applies to counties with more than 75,000 people based on the 2010 census. [@uniform1975a] While renters in Shelby County qualify for protection under URLTA, residents of neighboring Tennessee counties are excluded.[^1]

[^1]: The Memphis MSA covers three states: Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Residents in Mississippi counties are protected under URLTA with no population exemptions. However, Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with no warranty of habitability for renters, and thus landlords are not legally required to maintain habitable conditions.

Under Tennessee's URLTA, landlords are required to comply with building and housing codes, make repairs, and keep the premises clean and safe [@uniform1975a §304]. They must provide "essential services," which include utilities and obligations which "materially affect the health and safety of the tenant" [@uniform1975a §502(3)]. If a landlord fails to supply essential services, tenants "shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the breach" and do one of the following: obtain essential services and deduct their cost from the rent; recover damages based on the decrease in the fair rental value; or procure reasonable substitute housing, during which the tenant is excused from paying rent during the period of noncompliance [@uniform1975a §502(1)].

Tenants who give their landlord written notice and follow the remedies laid out in the code are supposed to be protected from retaliation, including rent increases, decreased services, or eviction [@uniform1975a §514]. This may adequately protect tenants under a long-term lease; however, protections are more vague for tenants on short-term leases. Landlords are allowed to evict week-to-week or month-to-month tenants for no cause, as long as adequate notice is given (10 or 30 days, respectively) [@uniform1975a §512].

How are tenants meant to be protected from retaliatory eviction if landlords need no cause to evict in the first place? How long do retaliation protections last? These arguments have lead some states, like California and Washington, to enact "just cause" eviction ordinances, requiring landlords to provide a specific, valid reason to evict tenants (such as non-payment of rent) [@apstaff2021]. With the absence of such protections in Tennessee, lawyers at local renter rights meetings recommend tenants continue paying rent and keep a record of any photos, receipts, and conversations with their landlord to improve their chances in court.

# Code Enforcement

As stated above, URLTA requires landlords to comply with building and housing codes, which are established at the local level. In 2018, Memphis replaced local housing codes by adopting the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) [@harrison2018]. The IPMC sets minimum housing standards for existing residential buildings and related environmental conditions. The IPMC is enforced by the Department of Code Enforcement [@codeenf].

While state and local laws vary, the use of code enforcement to enforce local housing codes is standard across American cities. Typically, residents are told to call '311' to report any problems to a city. This method of self-reporting, while convenient for residents, can create biases in the data and the types of issues code enforcement pursues. A recent study of Kansas City 311 data found that, despite greater need, low-income and minority neighborhoods are less likely to report street condition or "nuisance" issues, while prioritizing more serious problems [@kontokosta2021]. Two extensive reports of Memphis code enforcement found that reliance on self-reporting led inspectors to spend a disproportionate amount of time on minor cases, rather than more serious violations [@betts2001; @stacy2018].

The Memphis reports, though released nearly two decades apart, contained similar findings and recommendations. Each saw the vast majority of violations were related to nonstructural issues like weeds, junk, and vehicles: the 2001 paper found three out of four properties were cited for these problems, and the 2018 paper stated 81% of all requests were nonstructural [@betts2001 93; @stacy2018 48]. Apartment complexes tend to be underreported compared to single-family homes or duplexes [@stacy2018 58]. The @betts2001 paper conducted a visual survey of properties in the Binghampton neighborhood, and while at least half of multi-family properties had violations in multiple units, code enforcement recorded only eight violations out of 1200 apartment units. Both reports recommended fundamentally changing code enforcement from a reactive process built on citizen reporting to a proactive, strategic system [@betts2001 9; @stacy2018 13].

Memphis has already taken this to heart by founding the [Strategic Code Enforcement Management Academy](http://strategiccodeenforcement.com/) (SCEMA) in 2017, which invites individuals from cities around the country to learn and share best practices for code enforcement.

## Code Enforcement Process

Despite an emphasis on strategic enforcement, most code enforcement cases still begin with a citizen report, either by calling 311 or using the app [SeeClickFix](https://seeclickfix.com/). Once a complaint is received, an investigation is conducted to assess the violation, determine property ownership, and research past violations at the property. If a violation is found, a code inspector will issue a "Notice to Correct Violation" to the property owner. 

After a notice is issued, follow-up inspections are conducted to determine compliance. Depending on the circumstances and severity, the department can then: give an extension; cite the owner to court; issue an order to vacate; issue an order to not occupy until repairs are made; or refer the property to the Condemnation Department. Cases where court action is initiated are resolved in the General Sessions Environmental Court [@codeenf].
