Happy holidays! Though I didn't get a Christmas tree 🎄this year, I would like to share my Census tree 🌳.

The Census collects a lot of information. The Bureau uses variables to identify the information they distribute digitally. Related variables are usually numbered close together, but not always. Knowing which variable you're looking for can make research go faster, and ensures you're working with the right data.[^1] A list of all variables is available on the [Census API website](https://api.census.gov/data/2019/acs/acs5/variables.html). The **tidycensus** R package makes this information easily available so you can search and filter for the variables you need.

[^1]: Watch out for similar datasets like **B25008**: "Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure" and **B25003**: "Households by Tenure".

## Backstory

For a long time I've been trying to find a way to visualize the variables to better understand what information is available. First I was manually drawing out the variables

![A first draft of a tree of some Census variables related to housing. (Oct 2021)](vars.png)

![Another early draft of how Census variables are connected. (Oct 2021)](varshoneycomb2.png)

These drafts were helpful at getting started but they were tedious to manually draw. I knew there was a better way digitally but I wanted something more than a table. I looked into how to make diagrams using [DiagrammeR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html), but I couldn't figure out the functions to turn the variables into a massive diagram.

### Homebrew & Tree

Outside of R, I've been getting more comfortable using the Terminal on my Mac. I've been using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for a while to download apps and packages for my computer. There's only a few simple commands to learn, so it makes programming less scary. If I need to install Firefox on my computer, instead of going to a website, clicking download, and dragging the download to the application folder, I type `brew install --cask firefox` and it just does everything.

Since I've gotten more comfortable with Homebrew, I like checking their analytics page for the [most popular recent installs](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/cask-install/30d/). This is how I also learned about [tree](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tree), which displays directories (folders 📁) in a visual, nested format. I realized this is what I was looking for to visualize Census variables.

I got good at using `mkdir` to create new and name folders from the command line. Copy and pasting variables was more efficient than my earlier drawings, but I knew it was still taking too long and I was making errors. Still, I got a better idea of what I wanted: each variable ID next to its final variable, with the remainder of its variables nested.

``` zsh
#' Attempt at manually building a Census tree.

```

In my programming studies, I've learned computers are really good at going through text files. It's common to have a program run through a .txt file and apply the same function to each line. I knew I could use R to convert a `.csv` of Census variables into a list of folders. I still didn't know how to turn it into real folders, but thankfully searching online quickly returned exactly that I was looking for, from [this post by Senthil Kumar](https://ostechnix.com/create-directories-text-file-linux/).

## R Code

Without further ado, here's how to reorganize Census variables to create a folder tree.

### Get variables

To get started, we'll need the **tidycensus** package to access the Census API's list of variables, and **tidyverse** to wrangle the data into the correct format.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
```

Use the `load_variables()` function to get the variables from the dataset you need. I also went ahead and narrowed for housing-related variables (which start with "B25...").

```{r}
v19 <- load_variables(2019, "acs5")

hsg <- v19 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "^B25"))

head(hsg)
```

The tables above each have three columns:

-   `name`: the Census variable ID

-   `label`: the description of the variable ID/full, specific variables in the data

-   `concept`: the table the variable ID falls under/general variables in the data

We have the information we need to create our directory list.

### Tidy

Now we need to reorganize and clean the data into one column.

`filter()`: There are 2,207 variables related to housing, but I don't want a tree that is too long to digest (I can always make more trees). But every single age bracket, income bracket, etc. has its own variable, repeated many times over. So I narrowed to only the top-level variables, ending with "\_001". Some variables are also available by race or as aggregates or medians. These variables are useful but will not be the focus of this tree.

`mutate()`: Census data is pretty standardized, so there's not a lot of work to change the variables into what we need. Most of the mutating is related to cleaning up punctuation and spaces, since we don't really want those in a file name. I omitted the "B" at the start of every variable, so the variable ID number will appear at the top of folder lists.

Every time " BY " is mentioned in the `concept` column, it indicates a subvariable, which we need to turn into a subfolder `/`. Then append the `name` column to include the variable ID using `unite()`.

```{r}
h1 <- hsg %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "_001$"),           #' only top-level variables
         !str_detect(name, "[:alpha:]_"),     #' omit race variables
         str_detect(label, "Estimate!!Total") #' omit aggregates, medians, etc.
         ) %>% 
  select(-label) %>%     #' done using label column
  mutate(concept = str_replace_all(concept, "-(?=[:alpha:])", " "),
         concept = str_remove_all(concept, "[:punct:]"),
         concept = str_replace_all(concept, " BY ", "/"),
         name = str_remove(name, "_001"),
         name = str_remove_all(name, "^B")
         ) %>% 
  unite(col = "fileStr", concept, name, sep = "/", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(fileStr = str_replace_all(fileStr, "\\s", "-"),
         fileStr = str_replace_all(fileStr, "-{2,}", "-"))

head(h1)
```

We're left with one column and 76 rows. Now we're ready to turn our column into real folders. I'm also going to use more emojis so the code doesn't look intimidating.

### Export

Turn the column into a list of values. Then use `write_lines()` to create a `.txt` 📄, writing one line for every value listed.

```{r}
vH1 <- h1$fileStr

write_lines(vH1, file = "~/Documents/H1.txt")
```

This outputs the `.txt` 📄 to your Documents 📁.

## Terminal

Open the Terminal. Create a new 📁 to contain the tree and `cd` into the new 📁.

``` zsh
mkdir ~/Documents/census
cd Documents/census
```

Below is the function that creates a new 📁 for every row in the `.txt` 📄.

``` zsh
xargs -I {} mkdir -p "{}" < "../H1.txt"
```

### Tree

Finally, enter `tree` to see the finished product.

``` zsh
tree

Above is a list of all Census tables that start with "B25", omitting certain rows. So, if you're looking for "Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure", use table B25008. To find "Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure by Units in Structure", use table B25033. You can use these variables on [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).

Once the folder structure is made, you have a handy Census variable reference on your computer. Just `cd` into the folder and enter `tree` to see it all again. The `find` command can be used in Terminal to search the current directory (`.`) for a word, with an asterisk `*` as a wildcard.

``` zsh
find . -name "AGE*"
./AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
./TENURE/AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
./TENURE/VEHICLES-AVAILABLE/AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
./TENURE/TELEPHONE-SERVICE-AVAILABLE/AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
./TENURE/HOUSEHOLD-SIZE/AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
./MORTGAGE-STATUS/AGE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER
```

The R code [above](https://sarahjohnson.io/_reference/2021-12-24-census-tree/census-tree.html#r-code) can also be changed to return a different combination of variables and create a different folder structure. Let me know if you figure out another way to organize.

Happy holidays ⛄🎄🔔
