Hello, I'm Sarah ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently the Intake and Outreach Coordinator at the Shelby County Department of Housing. I received my bachelor's in economics and master's in urban planning from the University of Memphis. When I'm not working, I enjoy rock climbing and [playing Mario Kart](https://sarah.fyi/).
