Tackling the crisis\nrequires understanding a place’s existing market, the needs of its\nresidents, and the laws that shape how the market functions. This post\nwill examine Census data to learn: how many people live in the Memphis\narea, how many housing units exist, how many are vacant, and how these\nfigures have changed over the past decade.\nPopulation and Households\nThere are two main ways to measure population using Census data: the\ntotal population and the number of households. The Census Bureau\npublishes more robust data on households, so this figure is more\ncommonly used for in-depth housing analysis. Typically an increase (or\ndecrease) in the population is tandem with an increase (or decrease) in\nthe number of households. This was not the case in Memphis, where a\nstagnant population illuminated changes in household composition.\nThe following table shows the total population, number of households,\nand average household size in Memphis, Shelby County, and the Memphis\nMetro Area. Below each area are the 2020 estimates and the percent\nchange from 2010 to 2020.\n\n\nPopulation and Households in Memphis Area\n    Inclusive geographies\n     \n      \n        Memphis\n      \n      \n        Shelby County\n      \n      \n        Memphis Metro\n      \n    2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n    Population\n635,650\n−0.12%\n919,577\n2.01%\n1,319,065\n3.65%Households\n255,756\n3.76%\n356,607\n4.75%\n505,544\n6.12%Avg HH Size\n2.49\n−3.49%\n2.58\n−2.64%\n2.61\n−2.25% Population is the Total Population in Occupied Housing, which excludes people living in group quarters.\n     Source: 5-Year ACS 2005-2010 & 2015-2020\n    \n\nThere were 1.3 million people living in the Memphis MSA in 2020,\naccording to the 5-Year American Community Survey. Most of the\npopulation lived within Shelby County (70%), and just under half lived\ninside the City of Memphis (48%). While the county and metro area saw\nmodest increases in population from 2010 to 2020, Memphis had a slight\ndecrease, enough to consider the population stagnant.\nHowever, the number of households increased in all jurisdictions. How\ncan the population of the city decrease while the number of households\nincrease? The answer is a decrease in household size, meaning fewer\npeople are living together. This is shown by the 3.5% decrease in\naverage household size over the past decade.\nThis means that even though the population in the city\nremained stagnant, there was still an increase in the demand for\nhousing over the past decade.\nTo better see the rate of growth outside of the city, the table below\nsubtracts Memphis data from Shelby County, and Shelby County data from\nthe Memphis Metro region.\n\n\nPopulation and Households in Memphis Area\n    Exclusive geographies\n     \n      \n        Memphis\n      \n      \n        Shelby County\n      \n      \n        Memphis Metro\n      \n    2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n    Population\n635,650\n−0.12%\n283,927\n7.14%\n399,488\n7.61%Households\n255,756\n3.76%\n100,851\n7.35%\n148,937\n9.56% Population is the Total Population in Occupied Housing, which excludes people living in group quarters.\n     Source: 5-Year ACS 2005-2010 & 2015-2020\n    \n\nWhile the city’s population remained flat, there was strong growth in\nShelby County and even more outside the county limits. Memphis is\ncurrently attempting to encourage denser development and to “build up\nnot out”, however the highest growth has been in areas furthest away\nfrom the city center.\nHousing Units\nThe housing market collapse of 2008 caused a decrease in new\ndevelopments in the ensuing decade, tightening the supply. How much was\nthis seen in Memphis?\nThe table below shows the total number of housing units in the\nMemphis area, and how many of those units were occupied or vacant.\nBecause a unit must contain a household to be considered occupied, the\nnumber of occupied units under each area is identical to the total\nnumber of households in the above tables.\n\n\nHousing Units in Memphis Area\n    Inclusive geographies\n     \n      \n        Memphis\n      \n      \n        Shelby County\n      \n      \n        Memphis Metro\n      \n    2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n    Total Housing Units\n299,599\n1.21%\n406,026\n2.45%\n569,954\n4.47%Occupied Units\n255,756\n3.76%\n356,607\n4.75%\n505,544\n6.12%Vacant Units\n43,843\n−11.47%\n49,419\n−11.53%\n64,410\n−6.86%Vacancy Rate\n14.6%\n−12.53%\n12.2%\n−13.65%\n11.3%\n−10.85% Source: 5-Year ACS 2005-2010 & 2015-2020\n    \n\nOverall, there was a significant decrease in vacancy in the Memphis\narea. Between 2010 and 2020, the city saw a drop of 5,680 vacant units\n(-11.5%) and an increase of 9,261 occupied units (3.8%). Since real\nnumber increase in occupied units exceeded the decrease in vacant units,\nwe can conclude there was some new development–a minimum of 3,581 units.\nThis is considerably small considering the 10 year time span.\nTo better analyze changes in housing units for areas outside the\ncity, the following table subtracts Memphis data from Shelby County and\nShelby County data from the Memphis Metro region.\n\n\nHousing Units in Memphis Area\n    Exclusive geographies\n     \n      \n        Memphis\n      \n      \n        Shelby County\n      \n      \n        Memphis Metro\n      \n    2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n      2020\n      2010-2020\n    Total Housing Units\n299,599\n1.21%\n106,427\n6.12%\n163,928\n9.84%Occupied Units\n255,756\n3.76%\n100,851\n7.35%\n148,937\n9.56%Vacant Units\n43,843\n−11.47%\n5,576\n−12.01%\n14,991\n12.76%Vacancy Rate\n14.6%\n−12.53%\n5.2%\n−17.09%\n9.1%\n2.65% Source: 5-Year ACS 2005-2010 & 2015-2020\n    \n\nWhile Memphis has a high vacancy rate (14.6%), the county outside the\ncity has a significantly lower rate of 5.2%. The county saw an increase\nof 6,903 occupied units and a decrease in 761 vacant units, meaning at\nleast 6,142 new units were developed.\nRemoving the county’s data from the metro reveals that the outlying\narea saw an increase in the number of vacant units and vacancy rate, in\ncontrast to the city and county. Overall, there was an increase of\n12,992 occupied units AND an increase in 1,696 vacant units. This\ncombination of increased occupancy and vacancy signifies substantial new\ndevelopment in areas outside Shelby County–at least 14,688 units. The\nincrease in the vacancy rate also suggest that supply in these areas may\nexceed demand.\nIn total, at least 24,411 new housing units were developed in the\nMemphis area from 2010-2020, with development primarily in the metro\narea outside Shelby County.\nDespite most development occurring outside the city limits and large\ndrops in vacancy, this data suggests Memphis still has tens of thousands\nof existing units that should be available. However, the quality of\nthese homes may make them uninhabitable, the area may be undesirable, or\nthe costs may be too high for existing residents to afford. This\ninformation is outside the scope of this post and further research is\nneeded to draw any conclusions.\nConclusion\nMemphis’s population stagnated between 2010 and 2020, hovering around\n635,000 people. Over this same time period, a decrease in average\nhousehold size lead to an increase in the number of households. This\nmeans that while the population in the city remained flat, there was\nstill an increase in the demand for housing over the past decade.\nMeanwhile, areas outside the city saw strong population/household\ngrowth. Despite a recent desire by city officials to increase density,\nnew development over the past decade was primarily in the metro region\noutside the county limits. Though the vacancy rate in Memphis has\ndecreased, the figure is still high and a large portion of the existing\nhousing stock should still be available for occupancy. Further research\nis needed on the quality, cost, and location of this housing to\ndetermine actual availability.\n\n\n\n",
