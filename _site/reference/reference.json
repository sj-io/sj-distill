Civil Action to Enforce Compliance — Draft Order of Compliance\nAn acceptable petitioner may file a petition for a judgment in rem against a subject parcel, naming the subject parcel as the defendant and seeking an order that the subject parcel is a public nuisance and for the abatement of the public nuisance. A proceeding pursuant to this section shall be a proceeding in rem. If the applicable municipal corporation is not the acceptable petitioner, then the applicable municipal corporation shall be put on notice of the in rem proceeding and provided with a full copy of the petition as filed by the acceptable petitioner. If the acceptable petitioner has not attached a certificate of public nuisance to the petition, the municipal corporation shall complete an inspection of the subject parcel within thirty (30) calendar days after the first setting of the matter in court, and the court shall promptly schedule a hearing on the issue of public nuisance. At the conclusion of the hearing on the issue of public nuisance, the court shall determine whether or not the issuance of a certificate of public nuisance is warranted. The court shall dismiss the action if the subject parcel is found not to be a public nuisance by the court.\nThe petition filed pursuant to subsection (a) must include a draft order of compliance setting forth the relief requested as described in this section and shall specifically request the appointment of a receiver if an order of compliance pursuant to subsection (e) is entered and if the owner fails to comply with such order.\nThe filing of a petition for a judgment in rem pursuant to subsection (a) shall:\nCreate a receiver’s lien that secures an undetermined amount until the court establishes the amount. The precise amount of the receiver’s lien will be established by the court at any time upon the request of any owner, interested person, or the receiver. The receiver’s lien shall be a first lien on the subject parcel, which is superior to all prior and subsequent liens or other encumbrances associated with the subject parcel. The acceptable petitioner shall file for record in the register’s office of the county an abstract certified by the clerk, within one (1) day of certification by the clerk, containing the names of the parties to the suit, a statement that petition has been filed pursuant to this section, a description of the subject parcel and its ownership, and a brief statement of the nature and amount of the lien sought to be imposed, all in compliance with § 20-3-101, which filing shall act as a lien lis pendens against the subject parcel. The outstanding principal amount of the receiver’s lien carries interest at a standard statutory rate applicable to judgment liens as provided in § 67-5-2010;\nAct as a bar of any transfer of title of the subject parcel or of any interests pertaining to such subject parcel, including, but not limited to, transfers by tax sale or other foreclosure, transfers or creation of lien interests in the subject parcel, or otherwise, from the date of the filing until the petition is dismissed or until specific orders of the court authorizing a transfer of title, if the petition has attached a certificate of public nuisance issued pursuant to subsection (a); and\nAuthorize the municipal corporation, in its discretion, to access the subject parcel for boarding, securing, and maintaining the subject parcel at any time if it has been determined by the court that the owner has failed to do so. Any costs incurred by the municipal corporation shall be charged to the owner.\n\nNotice of a petition for a judgment in rem filed pursuant to subsection (a) shall, at a minimum, be provided to each owner and interested person identified by a thorough title search and examination of the subject parcel, including a search of court records of the county where the subject parcel is located. The petitioner shall file with the court a certification that notice has been provided pursuant to this subsection (d). Notice shall be provided by:\nSending a copy of the petition by first-class mail to the last known address of record;\nPosting a copy of the petition in a conspicuous place on the building;\nPublication of the petition in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the subject parcel is located; and\nSending a copy of the petition by first-class mail addressed to “occupant” at the subject parcel.\n\nIf the subject parcel is found to be a public nuisance, the court shall issue an order of compliance requiring the owner of the subject parcel to produce a plan for the abatement of the public nuisance. The acceptable petitioner shall file such order in the register’s office of the county where the subject parcel is located. The plan must comply with subsection (h) and must be approved by the court. If the owner has commenced work on the subject parcel prior to, or during the pendency of the action, the owner is required to provide a report of the work that has been completed to date, as well as a plan for the abatement of the public nuisance. Once a plan is approved by the court, the municipal corporation shall provide periodic updates to the court on the owner’s progress towards completion of the plan and other relevant information about the subject parcel and surrounding area. Upon a finding by the court that the subject parcel is a public nuisance, the court may award all reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the person filing the petition for a judgment in rem.\nIf the owner fails to comply with the court’s order of compliance pursuant to subsection (e), the court may allow an interested person the opportunity to undertake the work to abate the public nuisance pursuant to a plan that complies with subsection (h) submitted by such interested person.\nIf the actions pursuant to subsections (e) and (f) fail to abate the public nuisance, the court may authorize a receiver to take possession and control of the subject parcel to abate the public nuisance pursuant to a plan submitted by such receiver that complies with subsection (h). A receiver appointed pursuant to this chapter is not personally liable for actions taken pursuant to the receivership except for misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in the performance of the functions of the office.\nPrior to ordering any action be taken to abate the public nuisance, the court shall cause a detailed development plan to be submitted for review, which must include, but is not limited to:\nA. A detailed budget for abating the public nuisance; B. A projected timeline for abating the public nuisance; C. If repair and rehabilitation of the subject parcel are found not to be feasible, the cost of demolition of the subject parcel or of the portions of the subject parcel that constitute the public nuisance; and D. The terms, conditions, and availability of any financing that is necessary to abate the public nuisance or a show of sufficient assets.\nIf the receiver is submitting the plan, the receiver may petition the court for authority to conduct an auction and sale to a qualified buyer, in accordance with subsection (j), without abatement of the public nuisance upon showing that the terms of the auction minimum bid will include a bond or other security, in an amount fixed by the court, ensuring performance of the remediation within nine (9) months of the date of the auction sale, executed by the qualified buyer in favor of the receiver.\n\nIf the court deems a plan submitted by a receiver to be sufficient and appropriate, the court may empower the receiver to:\nA. Take possession and control of the subject parcel; B. Pay all expenses of operating and conserving the subject parcel, including obtaining property insurance; C. Pay prereceivership mortgages or installments of such mortgages and other liens; and D. Implement the plan; provided, that, if the plan requires demolition, the court shall order that the demolition be done properly and in compliance with applicable laws.\nThe receiver shall file a report with the court every sixty (60) calendar days and, upon completion of the detailed development plan, shall file a final report with the court indicating that the public nuisance has been abated and moving for the establishment of the full amount of the receiver’s lien. Upon a finding by the court that the public nuisance has been abated and establishing the amount of the receiver’s lien, the owner shall be put on notice that the owner has thirty (30) days from such finding to satisfy the receiver’s lien in full. If the owner satisfies the receiver’s lien in full during such time, the receivership shall be terminated by order of the court.\n\nIf the receiver’s lien is not satisfied by the owner pursuant to subdivision (i)(2), the court shall direct the receiver to offer the subject parcel for sale in accordance with the following:\nThe sales procedure shall follow the procedures provided in §§ 35-5-101 — 35-5-109;\nThe minimum bid at a receiver’s lien sale shall be the full amount of the receiver’s lien;\nIf any local land bank formed pursuant to § 13-30-104 notifies the receiver in writing in advance of the receiver’s lien sale that it wishes to enter the minimum bid for cash for the subject parcel, then such minimum bid shall preempt all other bids, and the local land bank shall be the prevailing bidder;\nIf there is no bidder at the receiver’s lien auction for greater than the minimum bid, the subject parcel shall be transferred by receiver’s deed to the receiver, and there shall be no requirement of cash payment of the minimum bid by the receiver;\nWhen the successful bid is paid in cash, the amount of the minimum bid is paid to satisfy the receiver’s lien, including payment to the appropriate property tax officials, of that portion of the receiver’s lien that constituted delinquent property taxes. Any surplus shall be distributed, as approved by the court, to the owner and interested persons in the priority in which their interests encumbered the subject parcel prior to the auction; and\nThe receiver shall report the prevailing bid at the sale to the court, and upon approval by the court, a receiver’s deed shall be issued to the successful bidder and promptly recorded in the office of the register of deeds. The county trustee shall be allowed a credit pursuant to § 67-5-1903(b)(1) for any local taxes and assessments that are not collected as a result of the failure of the receiver’s lien sale to receive a cash payment for the minimum bid pursuant to subdivision (j)(2). Title shall be absolute in the purchaser, and the interests of any interested persons prior to the auction shall be terminated as of the date of the sale. The receivership shall be terminated after the sale by order of the court after a hearing on receiver’s motion for termination of the receivership.\n\nNothing in this chapter limits the powers granted to a court having jurisdiction pursuant to § 13-6-107.\nThe monetary and other limitations specified in § 16-15-501(d)(1) upon any court with jurisdiction over an action described in subsection (a) do not operate as limitations upon any of the following:\nA. Expenditures of a mortgagee, lienholder, other interested person, or receiver that has been selected pursuant to subsection (f) or (g) to undertake the work and to furnish the materials necessary to abate a public nuisance; B. Any notes issued by a receiver; C. Any mortgage granted by a receiver; D. Expenditures in connection with the foreclosure of a mortgage granted by a receiver in accordance with subsection (i); E. The enforcement of an order of a judge entered pursuant to this chapter; or F. The actions that may be taken pursuant to this chapter by a receiver or a mortgagee, lienholder, or other interested person that has been selected pursuant to subsection (f) or (g) to undertake the work and to furnish the materials necessary to abate a public nuisance.\nA judge in a civil action described in subsection (a), or the judge’s successor in office, has continuing jurisdiction to review and order correction of the condition of any subject parcel that was determined to be a public nuisance pursuant to this chapter.\n\n13-6-107. Jurisdiction\nJurisdiction for civil actions filed pursuant to this chapter is conferred upon the chancery, circuit, and any court designated as an environmental court pursuant to Acts 1991, chapter 426.\n13-6-108. Qualification as a Certified Person\nAny person seeking to be qualified as a certified person shall make application to the applicable court in the county in which such person seeks to serve, on such form and according to such standards and procedures as such court reasonably may require, including the following, which the court may require to be brought current at any time, as applicable:\nAn external verification of good standing;\nThe articles of incorporation and bylaws or formation documents;\nEvidence of financial capacity to carry out an abatement plan, including audited financial statements of the person for the past five (5) years, where applicable;\nA formal conflict of interest policy governing the staff, officers, and the board of directors, if applicable;\nEvidence of the administrative capacity to successfully undertake the abatement plan; and\nAny other documents, evidence, or assurances that the court may require.\n\nAny local land bank formed pursuant to § 13-30-104 is a certified person for all purposes under this chapter. In the court’s discretion, an acceptable petitioner may also be qualified as a certified person who is appointed as a receiver.\n\n\n\n",

Though I didn’t get a Christmas tree this year, I would like to share my Census tree 🎄. This post can be technical and it helps to have some prior knowledge of Census variables to understand what I’m creating. If you’re feeling confused, I recommend viewing the two images below and skipping ahead to the final output.\nBackground\nThe Census collects a lot of information. The Bureau uses variables to identify the information they distribute digitally (ex: B01003: Total Population). A list of all variables is available on the Census API website. Variables often share/combine information. Related variables are usually numbered close together, but not always. Knowing which variable you’re looking for can make research go faster, and ensures you’re working with the right data.1 The tidycensus R package makes this information easily available so you can search and filter for the variables you need. In this post I use R and the Terminal to visualize Census variables.\nManual mapping\nFor a long time I’ve been trying to find a way to visualize Census variables to better understand what information is available. First I tried manually mapping out the variables:\nA first draft of a tree of some Census variables related to housing (Oct 2021). Drag the image to your browser’s tab bar to see it in full size.Another early draft of how Census variables are connected. (Oct 2021)These drafts were helpful at getting started but were tedious to manually draw. I knew there was a better way digitally, but I wanted something more than a table. I looked into how to make diagrams using DiagrammeR, but I couldn’t figure out the functions to turn the variables into a massive diagram.\nHomebrew & Tree\nOutside of R, I’ve been getting more comfortable using the Terminal on my Mac. I’ve been using Homebrew for a while to download apps and packages for my computer. There’s only a few simple commands to learn, so it’s helped make programming less intimidating. I like checking Homebrew’s analytics page for the most popular recent installs. This is how I also learned about tree, which displays directories (folders 📁) in a visual, nested format. I realized this could be used to visualize Census variables.\nI used the command mkdir to create new folders from the Terminal and began sketching out my digital tree:\n#' Attempt at manually building a Census tree.\n\nDocuments/census-old\n├── B01003_population\n│   ├── B26001_group-quarters-population\n│   └── population-in-occupied-housing-units\n│       └── B25008_tenure\n│           ├── B25026_year-moved-in\n│           └── B25033_units-in-structure\n└── B25001_housing-units\n    ├── B25003_occupancy-status\n    │   ├── B25003_002_occupied\n    │   │   ├── B25003_tenure\n...\n130 directories, 0 files\n\n#' ex. B25008: Total Population in Occupied Housing Units by Tenure by Units in Structure\nCopy and pasting variables was more efficient than my earlier drawings, but it was still taking too long, and manual entry was liable to mistakes. Still, I got a better idea of what I wanted: each variable ID next to its final variable, with the remainder of variables nested.\nIn my programming studies, I’ve learned computers are really good at going through text files. It’s common to have a program run through a .txt file and apply the same function to each line. I knew I could use R to convert a .csv of Census variables into a .txt list of folders. I still didn’t know how to turn a .txt list of folders into real folders, but thankfully searching online quickly returned exactly that I was looking for, from this post by Senthil Kumar.\nThe Code\nWithout further ado, here’s how I created a tree of Census variables, first using R to get the variables into the correct format and create a .txt file, and then using the Terminal to convert the .txt file into folders to form a tree.\nPart 1: R\nFirst, I use R to get a list of Census variables, change the format of the list, and export the list to a .txt file.\nGet variables\nTo get started, we’ll need the tidycensus package to access the Census API’s list of variables, and tidyverse to wrangle the data into the correct format.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\n\n\n\nUse the tidycensus load_variables() function to get the variables from the dataset you need.\n\n\nv19 <- load_variables(2019, \"acs5\")\n\n\n\nI also narrowed for housing-related variables, which start with “B25…”.\n\n\nhsg <- v19 %>% \n  filter(str_detect(name, \"^B25\"))\n\nhead(hsg)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  name       label                            concept         \n  <chr>      <chr>                            <chr>           \n1 B25001_001 Estimate!!Total                  HOUSING UNITS   \n2 B25002_001 Estimate!!Total:                 OCCUPANCY STATUS\n3 B25002_002 Estimate!!Total:!!Occupied       OCCUPANCY STATUS\n4 B25002_003 Estimate!!Total:!!Vacant         OCCUPANCY STATUS\n5 B25003_001 Estimate!!Total:                 TENURE          \n6 B25003_002 Estimate!!Total:!!Owner occupied TENURE          \n\nThe tables above each have three columns:\nname: the Census variable ID\nlabel: the description of the variable ID/full, specific variables in the data\nconcept: the table the variable ID falls under/general variables in the data\nFor example, table B25002 provides data on the occupancy status of housing units for a particular geography. B25002_002 is the number of occupied units, B25002_003 is the number of vacant units, and B25002_001 is the summary variable for the table, the total number of housing units (totaling B25002_002 + B25002_003). B25002_001 will be the same value as B25001_001.\nWe have the information we need to create our directory list.\nTidy\nTo prepare the data for our .txt file, we need to reorganize and clean the data into one column.\nfilter(): There are 2,207 variables related to housing, but I don’t want a tree that is too long to digest (I can always make more trees). I narrowed my scope to only the top-level variables, ending with “_001”. I also omitted variables that are aggregates, medians, or the same concept broken down by race. These variables are useful but will not be the focus of this tree.\nmutate(): Census data is pretty standardized, so there’s not a lot of work to change the variables into what we need. Most of the mutating is related to cleaning up punctuation and spaces, since we don’t really want those in a file name. I omitted the “B” at the start of every variable, so the variable ID number will appear at the top of folder lists.\nEvery time ” BY ” is mentioned in the concept column, it indicates a subvariable, which we need to turn into a subfolder /. Then append the name column to include the variable ID using unite().\n\n\nh1 <- hsg %>% \n  filter(str_detect(name, \"_001$\"),           #' only top-level variables\n         !str_detect(name, \"[:alpha:]_\"),     #' omit race variables\n         str_detect(label, \"Estimate!!Total\") #' omit aggregates, medians, etc.\n         ) %>% \n  select(-label) %>%\n  mutate(concept = str_replace_all(concept, \"-(?=[:alpha:])\", \" \"),\n         concept = str_remove_all(concept, \"[:punct:]\"),\n         concept = str_replace_all(concept, \" BY \", \"/\"),\n         name = str_remove(name, \"_001\"),\n         name = str_remove_all(name, \"^B\")\n         ) %>% \n  unite(col = \"fileStr\", concept, name, sep = \"/\", na.rm = TRUE) %>% \n  mutate(fileStr = str_replace_all(fileStr, \"\\\\s\", \"-\"),\n         fileStr = str_replace_all(fileStr, \"-{2,}\", \"-\"))\n\nhead(h1)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n  fileStr                                 \n  <chr>                                   \n1 HOUSING-UNITS/25001                     \n2 OCCUPANCY-STATUS/25002                  \n3 TENURE/25003                            \n4 VACANCY-STATUS/25004                    \n5 VACANT-CURRENT-RESIDENCE-ELSEWHERE/25005\n6 RACE-OF-HOUSEHOLDER/25006               \n\nWe’re left with one column and 76 rows. Each row is a folder structure for the Census variable.\nNow we’re ready to turn our column of folder structures into real folders. I’m going to use more emojis so the code doesn’t look intimidating.\nExport\nTurn the column into a list of values.\n\n\nvH1 <- h1$fileStr\n\n\n\nUse write_lines() to convert the list into a .txt 📄.\n\n\nwrite_lines(vH1, file = \"~/Documents/H1.txt\")\n\n\n\nThe output is a .txt 📄 with 76 lines, each line containing the folder structure for the Census table.

Transactions entered into before July 1, 1975, and not extended or renewed after that date, and the rights, duties and interests flowing from them remain valid and may be terminated, completed, consummated, or enforced as required or permitted by any statute or other law amended or repealed by this chapter as though the amendment or repeal has not occurred.\n(c) Unless created to avoid the application of this chapter, the following arrangements are not governed by this chapter:\n(1) Residence at an institution, public or private, if incidental to detention or the provision of medical, geriatric, educational, counseling, religious, or similar service;\n(2) Occupancy under a contract of sale of a dwelling unit or the property of which it is a part, if the occupant is the purchaser or a person who succeeds to the purchaser’s interest;\n(3) Transient occupancy in a hotel, or motel or lodgings subject to city, state, transient lodgings or room occupancy under the Excise Tax Act, compiled in title 67, chapter 4, part 20;\n(4) Occupancy by an owner of a condominium unit or a holder of a proprietary lease in a cooperative; or\n(5) Occupancy under a rental agreement covering premises used by the occupant primarily for agricultural purposes.\n(d) This chapter shall not apply to any occupancy in a public housing unit or other housing unit that is subject to regulation by the department of housing and urban development and owned by a governmental entity or non-profit corporation to the extent such regulation conflicts with state law, but shall apply to the extent that any such regulations defer to the application of state law.\n(e) In the counties in which this chapter applies, this chapter occupies and preempts the entire field of legislation concerning the regulation of landlords and tenants.

The agency or department is authorized to collect from a landlord filing the form a fee not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) per year.\n(3) If any information required under subdivision (a)(1) or the ownership of the dwelling units changes, the landlord who transferred the property by sale or otherwise, or the landlord’s agent, shall notify the agency or department of such change within thirty (30) days of the change in ownership.\n(b)\n(1) Any landlord who fails to register or who fails to send notification of change of ownership as required by this section shall be assessed a fine in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) per week by the agency or department of local government that is responsible for enforcing building codes in the jurisdiction where the dwelling units are located.\n(2) Prior to the assessment of the fine, the landlord shall be given an opportunity to appear and be heard at a hearing to be held concerning the landlord’s failure to register or failure to send notification of change of ownership. A written notice of the date, time and place of the hearing shall be mailed the landlord at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled hearing.\n(c) This section shall only apply to any county having a metropolitan form of government and a population in excess of five hundred thousand (500,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census.\n66-28-108. Notification sent by e-mail.\nIf the tenant provides an electronic mail address in the rental agreement, any notification required to be sent to the tenant pursuant to this chapter may be made by the landlord through electronic notification to such mail address, unless a provision in this chapter requires a specific form of notification other than electronic notification; provided, however, that the landlord shall not require the tenant to provide an electronic mail address as a condition of entering into a rental agreement.\nPart 2 Rental Agreements\n66-28-201. Terms and conditions.\n(a) The landlord and tenant may include in a rental agreement, terms and conditions not prohibited by this chapter or other rule of law including rent, term of the agreement, and other provisions governing the rights and obligations of parties. A rental agreement cannot provide that the tenant agrees to waive or forego rights or remedies under this chapter. The landlord or the landlord’s agent shall advise in writing that the landlord is not responsible for, and will not provide, fire or casualty insurance for the tenant’s personal property.\n(b) In absence of a lease agreement, the tenant shall pay the reasonable value for the use and occupancy of the dwelling unit.\n(c) Rent shall be payable without demand at the time and place agreed upon by the parties. Notice is specifically waived upon the nonpayment of rent by the tenant only if such a waiver is provided for in a written rental agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is payable at the dwelling unit and periodic rent is payable at the beginning of any term of one (1) month or less and otherwise in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each month. Upon agreement, rent shall be uniformly apportionable from day to day.\n(d) There shall be a five-day grace period beginning the day the rent was due to the day a fee for the late payment of rent may be charged. The date the rent was due shall be included in the calculation of the five-day grace period. If the last day of the five-day grace period occurs on a Sunday or legal holiday, as defined in §15-1-101, the landlord shall not impose any charge or fee for the late payment of rent; provided, that the rent is paid on the next business day. Any charge or fee, however described, which is charged by the landlord for the late payment of rent, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the amount of rent past due.\n66-28-202. Effect of unsigned or undelivered agreement.\n(a) If the landlord does not sign a written rental agreement, acceptance of rent without reservation by the landlord binds the parties on a month to month tenancy.\n(b) Any person or persons taking possession without payment of rent and failing to sign a written rental agreement delivered to them by the landlord or who enter without oral agreement are deemed to be trespassers and may be evicted forthwith and may be held liable for damages and rent for the term of trespass and reasonable attorney’s fees; provided, that if such person or persons pay rent, which is accepted by the landlord, such person or persons shall become tenants of the landlord.\n66-28-203. Prohibited provisions.\n(a) No rental agreement may provide that the tenant:\n(1) Authorizes any person to confess judgment on a claim arising out of the rental agreement;\n(2) Agrees to the exculpation or limitation of any liability of the landlord to the tenant arising under law or to indemnify the landlord for that liability or the costs connected with such liability.\n(b) A provision prohibited by subsection (a) included in an agreement is unenforceable. Should a landlord willfully provide a rental agreement containing provisions known by the landlord to be prohibited by this chapter, the tenant may recover actual damages sustained. The tenant cannot agree to waive or forego rights or remedies under this chapter.\n66-28-204.

Termination of periodic tenancy — Holdover remedies.\n(a) The landlord or the tenant may terminate a week-to-week tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least ten (10) days prior to the termination date specified in the notice.\n(b) The landlord or the tenant may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the periodic rental date specified in the notice.\n(c) If a tenant remains in possession without the landlord’s consent after expiration of the term of the rental agreement or its termination, the landlord may bring an action for possession, back rent and reasonable attorney’s fees as well as any other damages provided for in the lease. If the tenant’s holdover is willful and not in good faith, the landlord, in addition, may also recover actual damages sustained by the landlord, plus reasonable attorney’s fees. If the landlord consents to the tenant’s continued occupancy, §66-28-201(c) shall apply.\n66-28-513. Remedies for abuse of access.\n(a) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access, or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the landlord may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n(b) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but which have the effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct, or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the tenant may recover actual damages and reasonable attorney’s fees.\n66-28-514. Retaliatory conduct prohibited.\n(a) Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession because the tenant:\n(1) Has complained to the landlord of a violation under §66-28-301; or\n(2) Has made use of remedies provided under this chapter.\n(b)\n(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a landlord may bring an action for possession if:\n(A) The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in the tenant’s household or upon the premises with the tenant’s consent;\n(B) The tenant is in default in rent; or\n(C) Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit.\n\n(2) The maintenance of the action does not release the landlord from liability under §66-28-501(b).\n66-28-515. Administration of remedies — Enforcement.\n(a) The remedies provided by this chapter shall be so administered that the aggrieved party may recover lawful damages. The aggrieved party has an obligation and duty to mitigate damages.\n(b) Any right or obligation declared by this chapter is enforceable by legal action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.\n66-28-516. Obligation of good faith.\nEvery duty under this chapter and every act which must be performed as a condition precedent to the exercise of a right or remedy under this chapter imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance or enforcement.\n66-28-517. Termination by landlord for violence or threats to health, safety, or welfare of persons or property.\n(a) A landlord may terminate a rental agreement within three (3) days from the date written notice is received by the tenant if the tenant or any other person on the premises with the tenant’s consent:\n(1) Willfully or intentionally commits a violent act;\n(2) Behaves in a manner which constitutes or threatens to be a real and present danger to the health, safety or welfare of the life or property of other tenants or persons on the premises;\n(3) Creates a hazardous or unsanitary condition on the property that affects the health, safety or welfare or the life or property of other tenants or persons on the premises; or\n(4) Refuses to vacate the premises after entering the premises as an unauthorized subtenant or other unauthorized occupant.\n(b) The notice required by this section shall specifically detail the violation which has been committed and shall be effective only from the date of receipt of the notice by the tenant.\n(c) Upon receipt of such written notice, the tenant shall be entitled to immediate access to any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining a temporary or permanent injunction against such termination by the landlord.\n(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a landlord to recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action or otherwise including willful diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing interruption of electric, gas or other essential service to the tenant except in the case of abandonment or surrender.\n(e) If the landlord’s action in terminating the lease under this provision is willful and not in good faith, the tenant may in addition recover actual damages sustained by the tenant plus reasonable attorney’s fees.\n(f) The failure to bring an action for or to obtain an injunction may not be used as evidence in any action to recover possession of the dwelling unit.\n(g)\n(1) If domestic abuse, as defined in §36-3-601, is the underlying offense for which a tenancy is terminated, only the perpetrator may be evicted. The landlord shall not evict the victims, minor children under eighteen (18) years of age, or innocent occupants, any of whom occupy the subject premises under a lease agreement, based solely on the domestic abuse. Even if evicted or removed from the lease, the perpetrator shall remain financially liable for all amounts due under all terms and conditions of the present lease agreement.\n(2) If a lease agreement is in effect at the time that the domestic abuse is committed, the landlord may remove the perpetrator from the lease agreement and require the remaining adult tenants to qualify for and enter into a new agreement for the remainder of the present lease term. The landlord shall not be responsible for any and all damages suffered by the perpetrator due to the bifurcation and termination of the lease agreement in accordance with this section.\n(3) If domestic abuse, as defined in §36-3-601, is the underlying offense for which tenancy could be terminated, the victim and all adult tenants shall agree, in writing, not to allow the perpetrator to return to the subject premises or any part of the community property, and to immediately report the perpetrator’s return to the proper authority, for the remainder of the tenancy. A violation of such agreement shall be cause to terminate tenancy as to any victim and all other tenants.\n(4) The rights under this section shall not apply until the victim has been judicially granted an order of protection against the perpetrator for the specific incident for which tenancy is being terminated, a copy of such order has been provided to the landlord, and the order:\n(A) Provides for the perpetrator to move out or vacate immediately;\n(B) Prohibits the perpetrator from coming by or to a shared residence;\n(C) Requires that the perpetrator stay away from the victim’s residence; or\n(D) Finds that the perpetrator’s continuing to reside in the rented or leased premises may jeopardize the life, health, and safety of the victim or the victim’s minor children.\n\n(5) Failure to comply with this section, or dismissal of an order of protection that allows application of this section, abrogates the rights provided to the victim, minor children, and innocent occupants under this section.\n(6) The rights granted in this section shall not apply in any situation where the perpetrator is a child or dependent of any tenant.\n(7) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the eviction of a victim of domestic abuse for non-payment of rent, a lease violation, or any violation of this chapter.\n66-28-518.

Towing of vehicles.\n(a) A landlord may have the following vehicles towed or otherwise removed from real property leased or rented by such landlord for residential purposes, upon giving a ten-day written notice by posting the same upon the subject vehicle:\n(1) A vehicle with one (1) or more flat or missing tires;\n(2) A vehicle unable to operate under its own power;\n(3) A vehicle with a missing or broken windshield or more than one (1) broken or missing window;\n(4) A vehicle with one (1) or more missing fenders or bumpers; or\n(5) A motor vehicle that has not been in compliance with all applicable local or state laws relative to titling, licensing, operation, and registration for more than thirty (30) days.\n(b) If the owner of the vehicle is not present, then prior to removing the vehicle pursuant to this section, the person, firm or entity that actually tows the vehicle shall notify local law enforcement of the vehicle identification number (VIN), registration information, license plate number and description of the vehicle. Local law enforcement shall keep a record of all such information which shall be available for public inspection.\n66-28-520. Towing of nuisance vehicles.\nAny nuisance vehicle located on or about the premises of real property that has been leased or rented for residential purposes may be towed or otherwise removed from such premises by the landlord upon giving twenty-four (24) hours written notice by posting the same upon the subject vehicle.\n66-28-521. Termination of utility services.\nIf a written rental agreement requires the tenant to have utility services placed in the tenant’s name and the tenant fails to do so within three (3) days of occupancy of the rented premises, the landlord may have such utility services terminated if the existing utility service is in the name of the landlord.\n66-28-522. Testimony of manager against tenant.\nNotwithstanding a rental agreement to the contrary, a manager may testify against a tenant under this chapter in the same manner as a landlord or owner.\n\n\n\n",

Beside each act is the public law number, date the act was passed, a link to the original act, followed by a summary of the important points of each act.\nThis post was created by combining three sources who reviewed the history of federal housing laws: Coan (1969), Soifer et al. (2014), and McCarty, Perl, and Jones (2019).\n1930s\nHerbert Hoover\nFederal Home Loan Bank Act\nAN ACT To create Federal Home Loan Banks, to provide for the supervision thereof, and for other purposes.\n(P.L. 72-304, July 22, 1932)\nHome Owners Loan Act of 1933\n“The Federal Government first took a major step into [housing] in 1933 when, in the depths of the depression, it authorized the creation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. This Act enabled the Corporation to refinance the mortgages of homeowners faced with foreclosure and at the same time saved many financial institutions from insolvency because of the inability of these homeowners to pay off the then prevalent short-term mortgages held by these institutions.” (Coan 1969)\n(P.L. 73-43, June 13, 1933)\nNational Industrial Recovery Act of 1933\nThis Act, “in order to provide employment, authorized the use of Federal funds for the purpose of financing low-cost and slum clearance housing. Although the prime purpose of this legislation may have been to alleviate the financial distress and unemployment occasioned by the depression, the Federal Government now found itself in the business of being concerned about how its citizens were housed.” (Coan 1969)\n(P.L. 73-67, June 16, 1933)\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\nNational Housing Act of 1934\n“The broad objectives of the act were to:\nencourage lenders to invest in housing construction, and\nstimulate employment in the building industry.\n\n(P.L. 73-479, June 27, 1934)\nThe Act created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The FHA insured lenders against losses on home modernization and home improvement loans, created the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund to fund the operation of the newly created mortgage insurance programs, and established national mortgage associations to buy and sell mortgages.”\n“The FHA also institutionalized” the idea of 20-year mortgages. “If borrowers defaulted, FHA insured the lender for full repayment.”\n“In the early 1930s, a housing division was added to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA). The Housing Division acquired land across the country and built multifamily housing projects for lower-income families. However, the Housing Division’s activities proved controversial with local government officials who felt they were not consulted in the process.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nThis Act “created the Federal Housing Administration, established the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and authorized the chartering of national mortgage associations to provide a secondary mortgage market. This Act was to spawn three major governmental institutions that would play a significant part over the next three decades in encouraging the large-scale provision of single-family housing in this country.\nThe Federal Housing Administration, by demonstrating the feasibility of long-term mortgages and low down-payments, now an accepted practice in the mortgage field, would in later years be the means by which the great spurt in suburban development that took place after the Second World War would be made possible.\nThe vast system of federally insured savings and loan associations would be another important cog in the ever-increasing percentage of homeownership that was to be seen during this period.\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association, chartered pursuant to the provisions of the National Housing Act, would show the way to a true national market for federally insured or guaranteed housing mortgage paper.” (Coan 1969)\nNational Housing Act of 1937\nThis act “replaced the WPA’s Housing Division by establishing the U.S. Housing Agency (a precursor to today’s Dept. of Housing and Urban Development), and a new Low-Rent Public Housing program. States that wished to receive assistance in building low-rent public housing were required to establish quasi-governmental local public housing authorities (PHAs). These PHAs could then apply to the federal government for funding in the construction and maintenance” of developments.\n\n(P.L. 75-412, September 1, 1937)\n“The act declared that it was United States policy to\n\npromote the general welfare of the nation by employing its funds and credit, as provided in this Act, to assist the several states and their political subdivisions to alleviate present and recurring unemployment and to remedy the unsafe and unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of low-income, in rural or urban communities, that are injurious to the health, safety, and morals of the citizens of the nation.\n\nHousing was later a major issue in the presidential and congressional races of 1948, with Harry S. Truman pledging to address the postwar housing shortage and urban slums.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nThis Act, “building upon experience developed under earlier legislation which authorized the Federal Government to build housing for those who could not afford it in the private market, initiated the low-rent public housing program, basically unchanged in concept [in 1969]. This Act, with its emphasis upon the clearance of an equivalent number of substandard or slum dwelling units for those built by a local housing authority with Federal assistance, also was a forerunner to later legislation that focused specifically on the elimination of slum properties.\nDuring the war years, the Federal Government’s involvement in housing was primarily directed toward providing shelter for military personnel and defense workers and their families. However, one of the major provisions enacted during this time was Title VI of the National Housing Act (P.L. 77-24), which would be later modified to encourage the insurance of mortgages financed under extremely liberal terms for the purpose of providing rental housing for veterans. This program would later come to be known as the ‘608’ program.” (Coan 1969)\n1940s\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\nServicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (G.I. Bill)\nThis Act “contained provisions for the home financing plan for veterans called the Veterans Mortgage Program. The program provided mortgage insurance for 100% of the mortgage amount with no down payment, lower interest, and long terms. The 4%, 30-year Veterans Administration-insured mortgage not only allowed easy access to home mortgages, but by 1965 it had also contributed to the reduction of the annual cost of home ownership from 30% of median income to 21%. As a result, the increase in home ownership between the years of 1940-1956 topped that of the country’s entire preceding existence.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n\n(P.L. 78-346, June 22, 1944)\nHarry S. Truman\nHousing Act of 1949\nThis Act “declared the goal of ‘a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.’ The act:\n\n(P.L. 81-171, July 15, 1949)\nestablished a federal urban redevelopment and slum clearance program, authorizing federal loans of $1 billion over a 5-year period to help local redevelopment agencies acquire slum properties and assemble sites for redevelopment;\nreactivated the public housing program for low-income families (which had been on hold during World War II), authorizing subsidies to local housing authorities sufficient to build 810,000 units over six years;\nexpanded the FHA’s mortgage insurance program to promote home building and homeownership;\ncreated within the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture a program of financial assistance and subsidies to improve housing conditions on farms and in rural areas; and\nauthorized federal grants for research, primarily to improve the productivity of the housing industry.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n“It was in this Act that a National Housing Policy was set forth by the Congress, including the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family. To help achieve this goal, a very substantial increase was made in the amount of low-rent public housing authorized under the United States Housing Act of 1937, and a comprehensive program of assistance for the provision of rural housing was authorized by the Dept. of Agriculture. However, this goal was not quantified until the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968.\nAnother major feature of the 1949 Act was the institution of Federal assistance in the form of loans and grants to cities to carry out slum clearance and urban redevelopment activities. This program, now known as the urban renewal program, was a recognition that serious environmental problems existed in the older sections of our cities, that many of the problems could not be corrected without a complete clearance of the existing deteriorated and dilapidated structures and a complete rebuilding of these areas for both housing and non-housing uses, and that it was a Federal responsibility to help the cities cope with these problems. With the enactment of this program, the government was now committed to concerning itself with the urban environmental needs of the country as well as its housing needs.” (Coan 1969)\n“Democrats and Republicans joined to pass the landmark Housing Act of 1949, which committed the country to ‘the goal of a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family.’ The act also authorized the Urban Redevelopment Program, which provided federal funds for the demolition of slum housing in cities that established an urban renewal authority.\nAlthough the Housing Act of 1949 was relatively comprehensive in scope, political leaders remained reluctant to displace the private sector’s dominance in the housing industry. The U.S. Congress under President Harry Truman declined to include in the act a direct federal loan program for housing authorities and a housing program for low-income families ineligible for public housing. Even the Slum Clearance Program (later called “urban renewal”) financed urban demolition rather than development to provide an incentive for private builders to invest in urban areas instead of the more easily developed suburbs.\nThe private sector-public funding model of home ownership was not the only housing problem in postwar America. The New Deal had laid the groundwork for what became a “two-tract” housing system: government-supported home ownership for the middle class and limited “special” governmental programs for low-income renters. A Commission on Housing appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower examined the failures and inequalities of the two systems. The commission’s report led to the passage of the Housing Act of 1954.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n1950s\nDwight D. Eisenhower\nHousing Act of 1954\nThis act “authorized a broadening of the slum clearance and urban redevelopment program to include assistance for not only clearance activities, but also efforts aimed at preserving existing structures in run-down areas, where rehabilitation and conservation activities could bring these structures and their surroundings up to a reasonable standard and achieve the re-establishment of a stable neighborhood.\n\n(P.L. 83-560, August 2, 1954)\nThe Act required (now known as the workable program for community improvement) that a community, in order to qualify for assistance under the urban renewal and low-rent public housing programs, as well as certain FHA programs enacted to complete the urban renewal program, must indicate a willingness on a planned basis to take such necessary steps on its own as were possible to prevent further deterioration and work toward the establishment and preservation of a desirable community.\nThe 1954 Act also rechartered the Federal National Mortgage Association with the explicit intention that it ultimately be converted to full private ownership, a goal to be realized in the 1968 Act, and authorized the initiation of the urban planning assistance program, commonly known as the ‘701’ program. This latter program, initially authorizing Federal grants to assist planning in communities under 25,000 population and for metropolitan areas, was the Federal Government’s first decisive legislative step in the broad area of urban development as opposed to the narrower concern of good housing and the removal of blight.” (Coan 1969)\n“First, the law acknowledged that private mortgage insurance mechanisms of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) would not work for the inner city, so it established special insurance for housing in urban renewal areas. Second, the law also allowed private financing under the restructured Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae).\nBy allowing private investors to meet the demand for home mortgage money, Fannie Mae placed no demands on the federal budget. However, investor demands to limit risk soon pushed Fannie Mae and the FHA away from acting in the older areas of cities, diluting the intended benefits of the legislation.\nThe 1954 Housing Act required urban renewal authorities to submit a workable program for redevelopment after slum clearance in an attempt to correct the unilateral destruction of inner-city neighborhoods. The controversy over community destruction and its racial implications fueled action by progressive planners, settlement house and community workers, and civil rights leaders. Their unified response to “federal bulldozers” and “Negro removal,” as they termed this community destruction, resulted in improved relocation benefits for renters and citizen participation in planning in the reauthorization of the Housing Act in 1961.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nHousing Act of 1959\nThis Act “was the first significant instance where government incentives were used to persuade private developers to build housing that would be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.” Section 202 was the Housing for the Elderly program, through which “the federal government extended low-interest loans to private nonprofit organizations for the developments of affordable housing for moderate-income residents age 62 and older. Low-interest rates were meant to ensure that units would be affordable, with nonprofit developers able to charge lower rents and still have adequate revenue to pay back the government loans…\n\n(P.L. 86-372, September 23, 1959)\nSection 202 is the only federal housing program that funds housing exclusively for elderly persons, although from approximately 1964 to 1990, non-elderly persons with disabilities were eligible for residency in Section 202 properties. Although the Section 202 program initially provided low-interest loans to nonprofit developers, since the early 1990s the program has provided nonprofit developers with capital grants, together with project rental assistance contracts (rental assistance that is similar to project-based Section 8). The current version of the Section 202 program serves very low-income elderly households (those with incomes at or below 50% of area median income).” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n1960s\nJohn F. Kennedy\nHousing Act of 1961\nThis Act “further expanded the role of the private sector in providing housing to low- and moderate-income households. The act created the Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) housing program, which both insured mortgages to private developers of multifamily housing and provided loans to developers at low interest rates. The BMIR program expanded to pool of eligible borrowers to private for-profit developers and government entities, as well as nonprofit developers. Eligible developers included cooperatives, limited-dividend corporations, and state or local government agencies. Like the Section 202 program, the low interest rates in the BMIR program were meant to ensure that building owners could offer affordable rents to tenants.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 87-70, June 30, 1961)\nThis Act “created below-market interest rate subsidies known as the 221(d)(3) and 221(d)(4) programs and enabled the government to step in to purchase housing project mortgages. Public housing for the poorest families was expanded, and 100,000 units of low-rent public housing were added for the lowest income families. As a result, the below-market subsidy mechanisms established a second mode of ‘poor people’s housing’ that was separate from the conventional real estate industry and the income mix that had previously characterized minority neighborhoods.\nEven though President Kennedy allocated $2 billion for urban renewal, the increased federal spending under the Housing Act of 1961 emphasized physical development as the answer to housing problems in poor neighborhoods. Although the direct federal development support did help fill the vacuum left by the departure of the private sector from these neighborhoods, the public housing and government programs that replaced the private sector functions created an even larger divide between poor families and mainstream markets.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nThis Act “saw the first major effort by the Federal Government to attempt to provide housing for that large segment of the population whose incomes were too high to permit them to qualify for low-rent public housing, but too low to afford standard housing available in the private market. This was done through amendments to Section 221 of the National Housing Act, which had been enacted in 1954 for the purpose of providing favorable financing terms for housing for families displaced as a result of urban renewal or other governmental activities.\nThis took two forms: first, through the insurance of 3% down payment mortgages for terms up to 40 years on homes; and secondly, through the insurance of mortgages for apartment projects with interest rates set at the average cost to the Federal Government of borrowing money. This latter provision, commonly known as the 221(d)(3) below-market interest rate (BMIR) program, authorized 100% mortgages to public bodies, nonprofit organizations, and cooperatives, and 90% mortgages to corporations willing to limit their return to not in excess of 6% per year on their 10% equity investment. The funds for these below-market interest rate loans were to be made available by the Federal National Mortgage Association under its special assistance program, first authorized in 1954 to support mortgages for which there was not a ready market.\nThe 1961 Act also saw a major step forward in the Federal Government’s concern about the way the country’s urban areas were growing and the environment which was being created in these areas. It authorized grants to assist states and local communities to acquire land for the provision of permanent open space and the first direct assistance for the provision of mass transportation facilities in urban areas.” (Coan 1969)\nLyndon B. Johnson\nHousing Act of 1964\nThis Act, “among other things, endeavored to further encourage rehabilitation, instead of the clearance of run-down urban neighborhoods, by authorizing a direct 3% loan program to property owners to rehabilitate their properties located in urban renewal areas and the first Federal assistance for code enforcement efforts by a community.\n\n(P.L. 88-560, September 2, 1964)\nThe Act also took cognizance of the fact that the ever-increasing complexity of the problems confronting our urban areas and the number of programs to deal with them had caused a new problem– the lack of enough, adequately trained persons to deal with them. It authorized direct Federal assistance to States to establish programs to train professionals in community development and Federal fellowships for the graduate training of city planners and other urban oriented specialists.” (Coan 1969)\nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1965\nThis Act “added rental assistance to the list of incentives for private multifamily housing developers that participated in the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program. The Rent Supplement Program… capped the rents charged to participating tenants at 20% of their incomes and paid building owners the difference between 20% of a tenant’s income and fair market rent. P.L. 89-117 also created the Section 23 leased housing program, which was the first program to provide rent subsidies for use with existing private rental market units.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 89-117, August 10, 1965)\n“A major step to involve the private sector in the provision of housing for those who could not afford it was taken in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 with the enactment of the rent supplement program as a private counterpart to the low-rent public housing program. Under this program, a family with an income low enough to qualify for public housing could obtain a unit in a privately owned rental project with a market rate mortgage insured by FHA, paying 25% of its monthly income toward its rent, with the remainder being paid on its behalf to the project owners by the Federal Government. As the family’s income increased, the subsidy would decrease until ultimately the family would be able to pay the full cost of its rent. This Act fixed the maximum interest rate on the 221(d)(3) BMIR program at 3% instead of tying it to the going Federal rate, which was now threatening to reach 4%. It enacted a provision authorizing a local public housing authority to utilize the assistance received for the Federal Government to lease units in privately owned buildings for eligible low-income tenants, rather than constructing publicly owned projects.\nThe 1965 Act further expanded the Federal Government’s concern about the quality of our environment and the way in which our urban areas were growing. The open-space land program was substantially expanded; grants were authorized to help communities to provide water and sewer facilities and neighborhood centers and to acquire land needed for future development; and FHA mortgage insurance was authorized to cover the cost of acquiring and readying, through the installation of necessary site improvements, large tracts of land for the development of residential and related uses.\nAlso in 1965, the Congress recognized that the problems of the city had come of age and should be considered on a par with agriculture, parks and other major concerns of the Nation by establishing the Department of Housing and Urban Development.” (Coan 1969)\nCivil Rights Act of 1968\nThe Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act, “prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and handicap” (familial status and handicap were added as part of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, P.L. 100-430). “In addition to prohibiting discrimination, the Fair Housing Act also requires HUD and other federal agencies to administer their housing and urban development programs in ways that affirmatively further fair housing. In other words, as determined by courts, HUD is to prevent segregation and ensure that housing is open to everyone.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 90-284, April 11, 1968)\nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1968\nThis Act “created the Section 236 and Section 235 programs. In the Section 236 program, the government subsidized private developers’ mortgage interest payments so that they would not pay more than 1% toward interest. Some Section 236 units also received rent subsidies (referred to a Rental Assistance Payments [RAP]) to make them affordable to the lowest-income tenants. The Section 235 program instituted mortgage interest reduction payments similar to the Section 236 program, but for individual homeowners rather than multifamily housing developers. Through it, eligible borrowers could obtain FHA-insured mortgages with subsidized interest rates. As the program was originally enacted, HUD was to make subsidy payments to the lender in order to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage to as low as 1%…\n\n(P.L. 90-448, August 1, 1968)\nThe Section 236 program provided mortgage insurance to housing developers for the construction and rehabilitation of rental housing, and it continues to provide mortgage subsidies to building owners through a mechanism called Interest Reduction Payments (IRPs). IRPs are subsidies to owners that ensure they will only pay 1% interest on their mortgages. Given the reduced financing costs, owners can charge below-market rents for Section 236 units.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n“In [this] Act, the model cities program was authorized. Enactment of this program represented a recognition of the fact that it was often not sufficient to just renew the physical character of a neighborhood. It was also necessary to improve the social and economic conditions of the area: in effect, to give the people who lived in the large blighted areas of our cities not only the opportunity to have sound building and well paved streets, but also the opportunity to realize such basic goals as adequate employment, good education and proper medial care. It represents a recognition that these improvements must be achieved on a coordinated basis by a concentration of Federal, state, local, and private efforts and that the people whose lives are to be affected by these activities should have an opportunity to participate in the decisions affecting them.” (Coan 1969)\n“The United States was still reeling from urban riots in the late 1960s… The mainstream political establishment, in an attempt to pacify, rectify, or maybe even buy off the public (depending on one’s political views), responded immediately. The goal became to increase black home ownership as quickly as possible, and the Section 235 and 236 Programs, which addressed minority home ownership and indigenous nonprofit ownership of rental property respectively, were established in the Housing Act of 1968…\nAbuse and failure were the consequences of such a grand gesture. Money in the Section 235 Program flowed through whatever mechanisms generated the highest volume and numbers. Whatever positive effects the program had on building the assets of African Americans (Johnson & Sherraden, 1992) has to be balanced with the unintended side effect of destroying neighborhoods. Realtors used scare tactics and other block-busting methods to increase the volume of property available to first-time black homebuyers. They infiltrated predominantly which and integrated neighborhoods on the edges of ghettos and incited white flight. Adequate screening and support of homebuyers were sacrificed for volume (Pietilla, 2010). Virtually the whole west side of Chicago, the east and inner west side of Detroit, as well as other similar urban neighborhoods, experienced a cataclysmic change. The process was so corrupt that many realtors, mortgage bankers, and FHA officials went to jail for exploiting and abusing the program…\nThe Section 236 Program, which provided for nonprofit ownership of rental property, also fell victim to the “increase numbers at any cost” directive. This program was seen as an untapped vehicle to increase property ownership in the black community, so the federal government aggressively pursued black nonprofit institutions (e.g. fraternal organizations, churches) as sponsors for large-scale subsidized apartment properties. To compensate for the organizations’ inexperience in property management, HUD included the services of a consultant in each property deal. The consultant’s job was to assist the sponsor with planning the project as well as aiding in the application, negotiation, and acquisition phases of securing the property. For this service, the consultant received a 1% commission, payable at the time of the property’s closing.\nThe consultants were motivated to close deals and were effective at getting projects through the commitment pipeline to construction. However, as soon as the deal was done, the consultant moved on to the next project and the next commission, leaving an inexperienced nonprofit organization to manage the property. The result was chaos, and many projects failed. The federal government shouldered the negative financial impact of a high rate of foreclosures as well as a growing hostility toward nonprofit housing corporations among the public and federal agency staff…\nThe political pressures on the Model Cities program to produce large-scale results quickly also condemned the program to failure. For example, it called on community institutions to increase the volume of housing production by 400 to 1000% in just a year or two. The complications of achieving volume overwhelmed the program’s capacity and spirit. The government could not, or did not, continue to provide the massive, long-term resources that were needed in order to continue. Johnson’s attention subsequently shifted from the domestic housing agenda to the Vietnam War. Without adequate resources and federal support, the Model Cities program was ultimately canceled in 1974.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nRichard Nixon\nHousing and Urban Development Act of 1969\n“Under the public housing program, tenants generally paid rent in an amount equal to the cost of operating the assisted housing in which they lived. Over time, as operating costs rose, there was a concern that the below-market rents being charged were too high to be affordable to the poorest families. The Brooke Amendment, which was included as part of [this Act], limited tenant contributions toward rent in all rent assisted units (including public housing and all project-based rental assistance units) to an amount equal to 25% of tenant income (this was later raised to 30%). The Brooke Amendment is considered to be responsible for codifying an income-based rent structure in federal housing programs. (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 91-152, December 24, 1969)\n1970s\nRichard Nixon\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974\n“By the early 1970s, concern was growing about the cost, efficacy, and equity of the construction-based housing subsidy programs, such as the Section 236 and public housing programs… President Nixon declared a moratorium on all new activity under the major housing subsidy programs– except for the Section 23 leased-housing program… Assisted housing activity slowly restarted in response to lawsuits and new legislation.\n\n(P.L. 93-383, August 22, 1974)\nThe [1974 Act] was the first omnibus housing legislation since 1968… The act created a new low-income rental assistance program, referred to as Section 8. Although the 1960s had seen rental assistance programs like Rent Supplement and Section 23, the scale of the Section 8 program made it the first comprehensive rental assistance program. The Section 8 program combined features of the Section 236 program, which was popular with advocates of construction-based subsidies, and the Section 23 leased-housing program, which used the existing stock and was popular with the Nixon Administration. Through Section 8, the federal government provided private property owners monthly assistance payments for new or substantially rehabilitated rental units. In exchange for monthly rental payments, property owners agreed to rent to eligible low-income families (defined as families with incomes at or below 80% of local area median income), who would pay an income-based rent. It also provided PHAs with the authority to enter into rental assistance contracts for existing, private market units that met certain quality standards.\n…The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program… is administered by HUD. ..Its purpose is to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities primarily for low- and moderate-income persons. The CDBG program distributes 70% of total funds through formula grants to entitlement communities– central cities of metropolitan areas, cities with population of 50,000 or more, and urban counties– and the remaining 30% goes to states for use in small, non-entitlement communities.\nRecipient communities may use CDBG funds for a variety of activities, although at least 70% of funds much be used to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Eligible activities include the acquisition and rehabilitation of property for purposes such as public works, urban beautification, and historic preservation; the demolition of blighted properties; services such as crime prevention, child care, drug abuse counseling, education, or recreation; neighborhood economic development projects; the rehabilitation or development of housing; and housing counseling services.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n“President Richard Nixon came to office determined to cut federal domestic spending on antipoverty, urban renewal, housing, employment and training, education, and welfare programs. He offered local politicians a compromise: In exchange for fewer federal funds and smaller budgets, he would give them more control over how they spend the federal funds they received… [through] a ‘block grant.’\n… [T]he Nixon administration… locked horns with Congress and was unable to make the changes it desired to existing federal housing and development programs quickly. Therefore, Nixon issued an executive order that placed a moratorium on housing expenditures, freezing even projects that had already received federal commitment for redevelopment. The impasse between Nixon and Congress was not resolved until the Housing Act of 1974, which merged existing urban renewal programs into the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and consolidated a variety of housing programs into the Section 8 rent subsidies program.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nJimmy Carter\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1977\n“In 1977, Congress enacted the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) as part of the [1974 Act] (enacted as P.L. 95-128). The CRA affirms that federally insured depository institutions have an obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered and accept deposits, consistent with financial safety and soundness considerations, and requires federal banking regulators to assess the extent to which banks are meeting those needs. The enactment of the CRA grew out of concern that banking deposits were funding lending activities across the country at the expense of providing credit in certain areas where deposits were collected, thereby contributing to neighborhood disinvestment.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 95-128, October 12, 1977)\n“While courting private lenders to make mortgage and business loans in viable but economically threatened neighborhoods, organizers accidentally discovered the practice of redlining… In response, Congress enacted the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which required financial institutions to report the geographic origins of their deposits and the destination of the investments. The activists then asked for prescriptive action. The response was the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) which required financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities from which they took their deposits.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n1980s\nRonald Reagan\nHousing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983\n“Over time, the use of Section 8 in new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects was found to be more expensive than its use in existing housing. The [1983 Act] repealed HUD’s authority to enter into new Section 8 contracts tied to new construction and substantial rehabilitation, but retained HUD’s authority to issue new contracts for existing properties. The act also created a new demonstration program to test a modified use of Section 9, referred to as vouchers. Vouchers were similar to the use of Section 8 rent subsidies in existing housing, but they provided more flexibility to PHAs, particularly by permitting families to pay more than 30% of their incomes in rent. The demonstration was made permanent in 1985.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 98-181, November 30, 1983)\nRelated Acts:\n(P.L. 98-45, July 12, 1983) Department of Housing and Urban Development-Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1984\n(P.L. 98-479, October 17, 1984) Housing and Community Development Technical Amendments Act of 1984\nTax Reform Act of 1986\n“[T]he Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program was created as part of the [1986 Tax Act]. The LIHTC was not initially part of the bill that became the Tax Reform Act (H.R. 3838). However, because portions of H.R. 3838 eliminated the favorable treatment of real estate investment income, Members added the LIHTC program to the bill to ensure that developers would have an incentive to continue to construct low- and moderate-income housing. The LIHTC, intentially or not, was one of the first major programs to give a good deal of control over federal funding for housing to states. Tax credits are allocated to states based on population, and states have discretion in setting priorities as to how the credits will be used. While states much prioritize projects that serve the lowest-income tenants for the longest period of time, they may choose to allocate credits based on criteria such as the tenant populations served (e.g., those with special needs, families with children, or those on public housing waiting lists)…\n\n(P.L. 99-514, October 22, 1986)\nThe LIHTC… provides incentives for the development of affordable rental housing through federal tax credits administered through the Internal Revenue Service… The tax credits are disbursed to state housing finance agencies (HFAs) based on population. HFAs, in turn, award the credits to housing developers that agree to build or rehabilitate housing in which a certain percentage of units will be affordable to low-income households. Housing developers then sell the credits to investors and use the proceeds to help finance the housing developments. The benefit of the tax credits to the purchasing investors is that they reduce the investor’s federal income tax liability annually over a 10-year period.\nBecause tax credits reduce the amount of private financing required to build or rehabilitate housing, the owners of developments financed through tax credits are able to charge lower rents. To qualify for the tax credits, one of three criteria must be met:\nat least 20% of units in a development must be occupied by households with incomes at or below 50% of area median income;\nat least 40% of units must be occupied by households with incomes at or below 60% of area median income;\nor, more recently, properties have been allowed to adopt an ‘income-averaging’ approach that enables them to serve a mix of higher-income families if they also serve lower-income families, as long as it results in an average of 40% of units being occupied by households with incomes that average 60% or below of area median income (the income-averaging approach was authorized under the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 [P.L. 115-141]).\nRent charged for the rent-restricted units in a development may not exceed 30% of an imputed income limitation– calculated based on area median incomes. Units financed with tax credits must remain affordable for at least 15 years, although states may choose to adopt longer use restrictions. As of 2018, more than 2.3 million units had been placed in service using LIHTCs.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987\nCongress passed this Act which “included funding for several grants that states and localities could use to assist people experiencing homelessness. Grants were available for permanent and transitional housing, as well as supportive services, with the idea that localities are in a better position to know how to serve the people living in their communities.\n\n(P.L. 100-77, July 22, 1987)\n…The grants have gone through several permutations since their enactment, with the most recent change taking place when they were reauthorized in the 111th Congress…” (see below, P.L. 111-22) (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n1990s\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nNational Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (NAHA)\nThis Act authorized the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, “a housing block grant program administered by HUD and designed to expand the supply of decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing… HOME funding is allocated via formula: 60% of funds are awarded to”participating jurisdictions” (localities that have populations above a certain threshold and qualify for a certain amount of funding under the formula), and 40% are awarded to states. HOME grantees must match 25% of their HOME grants (with some exceptions) and submit a plan to HUD detailing their community housing needs and priorities.\n\n(P.L. 101-625, November 28, 1990)\nHOME funds can be used for four main purposes: rehabilitation of owner-occupied housing, homebuyer assistance, rental housing construction and rehabilitation, and the provision of tenant-based rental assistance. All HOME funds must be used to benefit low-income families (those with incomes at or below 80% of area median income), and at least 90% of funds used for rental housing activities or tenant-based rental assistance must be used to benefit families with incomes at or below 60% of area median income.\n…The Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program was created in 1990 as part of [this Act]… Until the enactment of Section 811, the Section 202 program provided housing for persons with disabilities.\nThrough Section 811, HUD provides capital grants to nonprofit organizations to create rental housing that is affordable to very low-income households (income at or below 50% of AMI) with an adult who has a disability. The program also funds project rental assistance contract to subsidize the rent paid by tenants. Housing built with capital grants may include group homes, independent living facilities, multifamily rental units, condominium units, and cooperative housing. Section 811 developers must provide supportive services to those residing in the units.\nIn addition, through FY2010 the Section 811 program created tenant-based rental assistance, sometimes called ‘mainstream vouchers,’ that tenants could use to find housing in the private market, much like Section 8 vouchers. However, since FY2011 (based on a law enacted in 2010 [P.L. 111-374]), Section 811 tenant-based assistance has been funded via the Section 8 account. Also as part of P.L. 111-374, Section 811 rental assistance funds were made available to be used in conjunction with capital funding from other sources (such as LIHTC and HOME funds).\n…The Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program is the only federal program that provides funding specifically for housing for persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related illnesses. ..HOPWA program funding is distributed both by formula allocation and competitive grants. HUD awards 90% of appropriated funds by formula to states and eligible metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that meet thresholds regarding population, AIDS cases, and AIDS incidence. Recipient states and MSAs may allocate grants to nonprofit organizations or administer the funds through government agencies. HOPWA grantees may use funds for a wide range of housing, social services, program planning, and development costs.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nJack Kemp, HUD secretary under George H. W. Bush, “expanded HUD’s economic development role, created new programs to encourage tenant management and tenant ownership of public housing, and promoted an enterprise zone approach to city and economic development. Kemp divested the secretary position of practically all discretionary authority, leaving only formula block grants and competitive bidding as means of awarding HUD funds. He also initiated a number of programs called HOPE I, II, and III to convert rental and foreclosed housing to homes available for ownership.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\nHOPE stands for Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everwhere. “HOPE I helps low-income people buy public housing units by providing funds that nonprofit organizations, resident groups, and other eligible grantees can use to develop and implement homeownership programs. HOPE I is authorized by the National Affordable Housing Act (P.L. 101-625), which added a new Title III to the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.” (HUD, n.d.)\nBill Clinton\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993\n“Under the Clinton administration, Kemp’s HOPE program was modified to include HOPE VI. The purpose of HOPE VI was to fund public housing authorities’ demolition of high-rise public housing and to replace it with lower-density, mixed-income, mixed-use projects that were developed by the private sector and large nonprofits. Despite some liberal opposition favoring one-to-one replacement of units as they were demolished, HOPE VI moved forward to eliminate virtually every dense high-rise project in the country. Tenants who were displaced and chose not to come back were given Section 8 vouchers.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n\n(P.L. 102-389, October 6, 1992)\nNote: For additional reading, on HOPE VI, see HUD’s overview and a 2004 report from the Urban Institute “A Decade of HOPE VI: Research Findings and Policy Challenges.”\nNative American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA)\nThis Act “reorganized the system of federal housing assistance to Native Americans by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with a single block grant program. In addition to simplifying the process of providing housing assistance, a purpose of NAHASDA was to provide federal assistance for [Native American] tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of [Native American] self-determination and tribal self-governance.\n\n(P.L. 104-330, October 3, 1996)\n…The act provides block grants to Indian tribes or their tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs) to use for a wide range of affordable housing activities through the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG) program. The tribe must submit an Indian housing plan (IHP), which is reviewed by HUD for compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. Funding is provided under a need-based formula, which was developed pursuant to negotiated rulemaking between tribal representatives and HUD. Tribes and TCHEs can leverage funds, within certain limits, by using future grants as collateral to obtain private loans for affordable housing activities under the Title VI Loan Guarantee Program.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nMultifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (MAHRA)\nThis Act was created “to preserve affordable housing. ..Through this effort, HUD restructures the debt of building owners while at the same time renegotiating their rental assistance contracts.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 105-65, October 9, 1997) Title V\nQuality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA)\n“Throughout the 1990s, concern about the state of public housing grew. The public perceived public housing to be mismanaged, of poor quality, and dangerous. At the same time, interest was growing in reforming social programs by devolving control to the states and increasing the programs’ focus on promoting work and self-sufficiency. Concern over the condition of public housing– and the influence of the 1996 welfare reform debate and legislation– led to proposals for major public and assisted housing reforms. Several years of debate in Congress culminated with the enactment of [QHWRA].\n\n(P.L. 105-276, October 8, 1998)\nThe purposes of QHWRA, as defined in the act, were to deregulate PHAs, provide PHAs with more flexibility in their use of federal assistance, facilitate mixed income communities, decrease concentrations of poverty in public housing, increase accountability and reward effective management of PHAs, create incentives and economic opportunities for residents assisted by PHAs to work and become self-sufficient, consolidate the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single market-driven program, remedy the problems of troubled PHAs, and replace or revitalize severely distressed public housing projects.\nSpecific reforms in QHWRA included increased income targeting in the voucher program, removal of federal preference categories for housing assistance, enactment of a limited community service requirement in public housing, creation of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (a hybrid of the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs), authorization of the HOPE VI program, consolidation and reform of funding for public housing, and modifications to the assessment systems of PHAs. QHWRA also featured the so-called “Faircloth Amendment,” which prohibited the use of public housing funding for the development of any net new units of public housing.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nAs part of QHWRA, “Congress passed a HUD request… for major reconstruction of public housing, allowing all local public housing authorities the freedom to develop HOPE VI-type mixed-income, mixed-use projects under its general authority and funding.” (Soifer et al. 2014)\n“Section 9(g)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (”Faircloth Amendment”) limits the construction of new public housing units. The Faircloth Amendment states that the Department cannot fund the construction or operation of new public housing units with Capital or Operating Funds if the construction of those units would result in a net increase in the number of units the PHA owned, assisted or operated as of October 1, 1999.” (HUD 2020)\n2000s\nGeorge W. Bush\nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA)\nThis Act created the Housing Trust Fund (HTS), “a block grant administered by HUD that is targeted primarily toward the development of rental housing for the lowest-income households… HTF funds are allocated to states via formula.\n\n(P.L. 110-289, July 28, 2008)\nHTF funds are to be used primarily for rental housing; however, by statute up to 10% of funds can be used for certain homeownership activities for eligible first-time homebuyers. Furthermore, all HTF funds must benefit households that are at least very low-income, and at least 75% of the funds used for rental housing must benefit extremely low-income households (or households with incomes at or below the poverty line). While the HTS is similar to the HOME program in some ways, it is more explicitly focused on rental housing and has deeper income targeting requirements than HOME.\nThe HTF is funded through contributions from… Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rather than through appropriations. Although the HTF was created in 2008, due to concerns about Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s financial situations, the first contributions were not provided to the HTF until 2016.\n…The Capital Magnet Fund (CMF)… is administered by the Department of the Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund… The CMF provides competitive grant funds to CDFIs or eligible nonprofit organizations to use to finance affordable housing and certain related community development activities.\nCMF funds can be used for either rental housing or homeownership, but they must primarily benefit low-income households. The CMF is meant to leverage other sources of funding, and eligible activities are supposed to leverage at least 10x the CMF award amount from other sources. Eligible forms of assistance that grantees can provide with CMF funds include capitalizing loan loss reserves or revolving loan funds and providing risk-sharing loans or loan guarantees, among other things.\nLike the HTF… the CMF is funded through contributions from the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rather than through appropriations. Although the CMF was created in 2008, the first contributions were not transferred to it until 2016 due to concerns about Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s financial situations.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\nBarack Obama\nHelping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009\nPart of this Act was the reauthorization of Homeless Assistance Grants, as part of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH). “The Homeless Assistance Grants consist of the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program, Continuum of Care (CoC) program, and Rural Housing Stability (RHS) program.\n\n(P.L. 111-22, August 24, 2010)\nESG funds are distributed to local communities and states by formula and may be used by grantees in two categories:\nemergency shelter and related services and\nhomelessness prevention and rapid rehousing.\nThe statute limits use of funds in the first category to the greater of 60% of a state or local government’s ESG allocation or the amount the recipient spent for these purposes in the year prior to the effective dat of the HEARTH Act.\nCoC program funds, distributed to nonprofit organizations, public housing agencies, and state and local governments via a competition, may be used for transitional housing, permanent supporting housing, rapid rehousing, supportive services, and Homeless Management Information Systems.\nThe RHS program has not been implemented, but would allow rural grantees to assist people who are experiencing homelessness in the same ways as the CoC program. The statute would allow RHS funds to be used for homelessness prevention activities, relocation assistance, short-term emergency housing, and home repairs that are necessary to make housing habitable. (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n2010s\nBarack Obama\nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2012\nThe Rental Assistance Demonstration “allows PHAs to remove their properties from the public housing program and instead receive a form of Section 8 rental assistance. As the program is currently authorized, HUD is authorized to approve the conversion of nearly half of the remaining public housing stock to Section 8 rent assistance.” (McCarty, Perl, and Jones 2019)\n\n(P.L. 112-55, November 19, 2011)\n\n\n\nCoan, Carl A.

A local developer, Chance Carlisle, said of rents in his upscale apartment building: “You can get something for $1,200 to $1,500,” he said. “It’s still dirt cheap.”\nConsidering that most new developments in the area have rents in this range1, I believe this quote hits on a disconnect between what developers believe is affordable, compared to actual incomes of people in Memphis.\nThe federal government determines affordable housing to be no more than 30% of a person’s income. Someone paying more than 30% is considered cost burdened; more than 50% is extremely cost burdened.\nThe following table lists incomes and corresponding affordable rents. This table does not account for any taxes that decrease take-home wages (and thus lowering how much rent one can afford) or if someone with an hourly wage works more/less than 40 hours a week.\nYearly Income is hourly wage * 40 hours a week * 52 weeks a year.\nMonthly Rent is 30% of the yearly wage, divided by 12 months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"caption\":\"<caption>Table 1: Incomes and maximum affordable rent.<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[7.25,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46],[15080,16640,18720,20800,22880,24960,27040,29120,31200,33280,35360,37440,39520,41600,43680,45760,47840,49920,52000,54080,56160,58240,60320,62400,64480,66560,68640,70720,72800,74880,76960,79040,81120,83200,85280,87360,89440,91520,93600,95680],[377,416,468,520,572,624,676,728,780,832,884,936,988,1040,1092,1144,1196,1248,1300,1352,1404,1456,1508,1560,1612,1664,1716,1768,1820,1872,1924,1976,2028,2080,2132,2184,2236,2288,2340,2392]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th>Hourly Wage<\\/th>\\n      <th>Yearly Income<\\/th>\\n      <th>Monthly Rent<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"pageLength\":20,\"columnDefs\":[{\"targets\":1,\"render\":\"function(data, type, row, meta) {\\n    return type !== 'display' ? data : DTWidget.formatCurrency(data, \\\"$\\\", 0, 3, \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", true);\\n  }\"},{\"targets\":2,\"render\":\"function(data, type, row, meta) {\\n    return type !== 'display' ? data : DTWidget.formatCurrency(data, \\\"$\\\", 0, 3, \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", true);\\n  }\"},{\"targets\":0,\"render\":\"function(data, type, row, meta) {\\n    return type !== 'display' ? data : DTWidget.formatCurrency(data, \\\"$\\\", 2, 3, \\\",\\\", \\\".\\\", true);\\n  }\"},{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[0,1,2]}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false,\"lengthMenu\":[10,20,25,50,100]}},\"evals\":[\"options.columnDefs.0.render\",\"options.columnDefs.1.render\",\"options.columnDefs.2.render\"],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nAccording to the 2019 ACS, the median household income in Memphis is $43,794; the corresponding maximum affordable rent would be between $1,095. Thus, while Mr. Carlisle says rents of $1,200 to $1,500 are “dirt cheap,” they are unaffordable to more than half of all households in Memphis. A household would need to earn between $48,000 and $60,000 to affordably live there.\nThe disparities get worse when we break down households by race, age, or number of people living in the household. The table shows median household incomes in 2019 for selected demographic groups.2\nTable 2: Median household income in Memphis, TN by demographic group (2019 ACS 1-Year)\nDemographic Group\n% of Households\nMedian Household Income\nOverall\n100%\n$43,794\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\n\nBlack\n61.2%\n$35,668\nWhite (not Hispanic/Latino)\n30.9%\n$69,395\nHispanic or Latino\n5.1%\n$35,704\nAsian\n1.8%\n$72,894\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\n15-24 years\n4.4%\n$30,390\n25-44 years\n36.6%\n$43,600\n45-64 years\n35.4%\n$50,256\n65 years and over\n23.7%\n$38,706\n\n\n\nPeople in household\n\n\nFemale, living alone\n21.4%\n$23,698\nMale, living alone\n17.6%\n$33,581\n2-person family\n26.2%\n$52,806\n3-person family\n13.8%\n$55,794\n4-person family\n8.6%\n$58,558\nBased on median household incomes, rents of $1,200 are mostly affordable to White and Asian households (32.7% of all households); households aged 45-64 (35.4%); and families with 2-4 person (48.6%).\nRents of $1,200 are mostly unaffordable to Black and Hispanic/Latino households (66.3% of all households); households aged 15-44 years and over 65 years (64.7%); and householders who live alone (39%).\nMeanwhile, rents would need to be $892 to be affordable to the median Black household; $760 for households age 15-24; and $592 for women living alone.\nTo be clear, this post is not meant to insult Mr. Carlisle; it’s possible his words were taken out of context and he meant that rents of $1,200 to $1,500 are cheap for an upscale apartment, or compared to rents nationwide. But when studying housing, it’s important to point out that affordability is relative and if you’re constructing housing in Memphis, where the minimum wage is still $7.25/hour, rents of $1,200-$1,500 are not considered affordable by a majority of residents (and thus should not be considered “dirt cheap”). There is a legitimate reason existing residents, particularly Black residents in a majority Black city, feel that new developments are not meant for them.\n\nAnecdotally, at least. I have not yet completed a full survey of rents for new developments.↩︎\nSome racial groups and family types have been omitted, so percentages may not total 100%.↩︎\n",
